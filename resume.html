  <h1>Computer Knowledge</h1>
  <p>I am very experienced in front-end development, and especially like making websites that respond intuitively with Bootstrap and update dynamically with angularJS. I also enjoy working with embedded systems, algorithms, and solving complex problems by hacking and breaking things. This is why I usually stick to software over hardware</p>
